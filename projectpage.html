      <p class="abstract">The ScholarWise project proposes the development of a Java-based Student Performance Analyzer equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project aims to address the need for efficient and user-friendly tools to analyze and manage student academic performance in educational institutions. </p>
        <p class="abstract">The proposed application provides a platform for educators, administrators, and students to access and interpret academic data, aiding in identifying trends, assessing progress, and implementing targeted interventions. By leveraging the Java programming language and GUI components, ScholarWise seeks to enhance user experience through an intuitive interface and dynamic data visualization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this project, we made an Automatic Irrigation System which irrigates the plants automatically and keep them healthy even when one is out of the town for weeks or months. A Moisture sensor is used to maintain the optimum level of moisture for the plants. This system can be implemented, both for gardens or for Indoor plants thus taking care of leafy plants when one are away.</p>
        <p class="abstract">The logic of this system is very simple - the moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil and when the sensor senses a low moisture level it automatically switches the water pump with the help of a microcontroller and irrigates the plant. After supplying sufficient water, the soil retains the moisture hence automatically stopping the pump. </p>

        <p class="abstract">This project implements context switching and round-robin (RR) scheduling for process management and resource allocation in amultitasking environment. Context switching allows for seamless switching between processes, ensuring efficient utilization of the CPU and fair allocation of resources.  </p>
        <p class="abstract">RR scheduling further enhances system responsiveness by dividing CPU time into fixed intervals (time slices) and granting each process a fair share of the CPU's attention. The implementation effectively handles process switching and I/O interrupts, ensuring smooth transitions between processes and maintaining system responsiveness. </p>

        <p class="abstract">The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a robust and cost-effective distance measuring system using an Arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor.</p>
        <p class="abstract">Our proposed idea revolves around the creation of a versatile and cost-effective distance measurement system. This system will employ an Arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to provide real-time and accurate distance measurements, which will be instantly displayed on a 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). </p>

        <p class="abstract">This project “TRAVEL AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT” is used to automate all processes of travel and tourism, which deals with creation, booking and confirmation and user details. The coding language used C++ and UML diagrams. Travel and tourism management system is used to book a tour from anywhere in the world by a single dynamic website which will help the user to know all about the places and tour details in a single website.  </p>
        <p class="abstract"> The admin can add packages to the website from certain travel agents and hotels by creating a tour page. Then the users can sign in and book each project, they can be confirmed by the admin in the managed booking page. The user can see the confirmation in my booking page. It is the easiest platform for all travellers which can be easily booked and know the all details. </p>
